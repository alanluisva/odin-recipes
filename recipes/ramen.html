    <h2>This recipe is spot on - with the benefit of being able to not only know exactly what went in, you can also add
        just about anything to it!
    </h2>

    <p>I've tried those make-your-own ramen seasoning recipes, but they taste nothing like ramen in my opinion. This
        recipe hits the spot, and there is no MSG or artificial ingredients.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce</li>
        <li>9 ounces soba noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine broth, water, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, and hot sauce in a pot; bring to a boil. </li>
        <li>Add noodles to boiling broth mixture and cook until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer noodles to serving bowls and top with desired amount of broth.</li>
    </ol>
